    "# Let's geocode some addresses\n",
    "\n",
    "Geocoding is the process of turning an address -- `'141 Neff Annex, Columbia, MO 65211'` -- into a latitude/longitude coordinate pair -- `(38.9480979,-92.3303756)`. You'd need to do this if you wanted to do some GIS analysis or make an interactive map or whatever.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our task**: To geocode the addresses of your internship newsrooms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our data** can be found here: `../../data/djnf_data_2018.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, we shall use a library called [`geopy`](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) with an open-source geocoding engine called [OpenCage](https://geocoder.opencagedata.com/api). Before setting up this script, [I signed up for an API key](https://geocoder.opencagedata.com/users/sign_up) and saved that key as an [environment variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) on this machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `geopy` library allows you to use other geocoding engines, including Google's, which is (in my experience) the most accurate. But [recent changes to its service](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/user-guide/account-changes/#no-plan) mean that you now must supply a credit card when you apply for an API key, which is why we're not using it here, but it's worth exploring.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also use our friend `pandas` and a couple of built-in Python modules: [`os`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) (to access the API key) and [`time`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html) (to pause between API requests).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our steps:\n",
    "1. Import the modules we need\n",
    "2. Grab the environment variable that your computer is keeping track of -- a key that will allow us to use the OpenCage API\n",
    "2. Set up the geocoder\n",
    "3. Read the data into a pandas dataframe\n",
    "4. Write a short function to geocode an address and return the coordinates\n",
    "5. Apply that function to each row of our dataframe"
