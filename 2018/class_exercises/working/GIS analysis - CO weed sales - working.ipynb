    "**Our goal**: To map per-capita retail cannabis sales in Colorado by county in 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our data**: A CSV lives here: `../../data/colo-cannabis-sales.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few things to note about this data:\n",
    "- Every row in our data is the sum of one month of sales for one category of cannabis (\"retail\" or \"medical\") for one county\n",
    "- Not every county in Colorado has retail pot shops\n",
    "- To maintain taxpayer privacy, the state releases aggregate sales data _only_ for counties with at least three dispensaries, and then only if none represent more than 80 percent of total sales, according to the Colorado Department of Revenue. Totals for counties that don't meet these criteria are represented in the data as 'NR'\n",
    "\n",
    "Other data we will use as we explore this topic:\n",
    "- `../../data/colo-county-pop.csv`: A CSV with Colorado county [FIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standards) codes, county names and 2016 population estimates.\n",
